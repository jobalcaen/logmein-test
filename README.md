#Deck of cards test

This test was completed using:
-webpack
-babel
-react
-Javascript ES6

All of the setup was done by me without the help of tools such as create-react-app or anything else that would automate the boilerplate.

To get started:
1. git clone
2.
	npm install
3.
	npm run start
4. navigate to localhost:8080 on your browser.
